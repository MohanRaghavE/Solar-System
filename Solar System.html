<p>Our solar system consists of 8 planets that orbit around the sun. In order from closest to farthest from the sun the planets go as follows: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. After Neptune comes Pluto, which is no longer considered a planet but a dwarf planet instead.</p>
